Add your answers to the questions below.

1. What is the runtime complexity of your ring buffer's `append` method?

its just straight up number maniputlation and so its linear O(1)

2. What is the space complexity of your ring buffer's `append` function?

still linear and with variable exhange but always the final variable solution, so O(n)

3. What is the runtime complexity of your ring buffer's `get` method?

O(n) either way!
4. What is the space complexity of your ring buffer's `get` method?

doesnt change at all, very flat like a O(n)

5. What is the runtime complexity of the provided code in `names.py`?

ran like the robot sort and so there are two lists looping, so O(n^2)

6. What is the space complexity of the provided code in `names.py`?

became a straight line to the end so one answer fluctiating to become itself at the end, O(n)

7. What is the runtime complexity of your optimized code in `names.py`?

still O(n)

8. What is the space complexity of your optimized code in `names.py`?

no matter the size its going horizontal forever, O(n)
